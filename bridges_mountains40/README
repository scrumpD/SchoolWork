=================================================

For this assignment, you will use the BRIDGES library to visualize pathfinding
your way through the mountains of Colorado. BRIDGES is a neat library, funded
by the NSF, that helps new programmers out by allowing them to visually see
the results of their work.

Your goal will be: given a starting row you will start on the left side of the
map and move one column at a time until you reach the right. At every tile,
you must look at the three square to the right, and choose the one that is
closest in elevation to your current spot, and move to it, AND SET ITS
ELEVATION TO -1.

The reason for this is that mountains are much easier to walk around than to
go over.

To get an A on this assignment you must:
1) (Three grades) Write a greedy algorithm that pathfinds from the starting
location to the end, minimizing the total vertical distance travelled 

2) (One grade) Write a blue line (yes, you'll need to change the color from the staring
code on the map showing the route taken, and visualize it on
BRIDGES (this bit is done for you, so just don't break it). You must also
change the title of the BRIDGES visualizaton to have your last names in it

3) (One grade) You must make your own map, at least 10x10 in size, and run the
algorithm on it. This is an important way for you to test your code for
correctness. Don't have any of the elevations be the same. The map file format
is simple, it starts with 2 numbers holding the size of the map, and then a
series of elevation data. If you're not sure how to do it, the best way is to
open up one of the existing maps in Vim and see how the files are formatted.
They're actually really simple.

To get a grade, you must allow me to run your code on all five maps (the four
ones I've given you and the one you created.) Don't crash on the map of the
Central Valley! There's a bug in the BRIDGES code you need to fix without
editing the map file. It's throwing an exception on line 120 on that map. Why?

To get BRIDGES working, you must register on their website to get a username
and API key. Enter these into the source code on the first couple lines of
main where you see variables for your name and API key. You can pick any
assignment number you want - I'm using 1001 for this one. The code is set to
not compile until you get a BRIDGES account, using a static assert.

Hopefully you will learn lots of things by seeing how other people write code.
Every instution has its own style and way of doing things.
