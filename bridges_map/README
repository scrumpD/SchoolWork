=========================================

Purpose: To learn how to modify/repurpose existing code that is similar to
what you want to do to do what you want to do.

Goal: Draw on a map the location of at least the top 100 cities in the world,
and then again at least the top 100 cities in the US.

Step 1. Download two different CSV files containing city location data. One
for cities in the US, and one for cities around the world (both have to have
at least 100 cities in their files). They have to have latitude and longitude
data for this to work. 

(Which files should you download? You figure it out! It's part of the
assignment. Kaggle is a good starting point, or just googling for city data
with longitude and latitude.)

Step 2. Load the CSV files into your C++ program here. You should use
file I/O, readline/getline until the next comma, etc. Store the data in a
"EarthquakeUSGS" object because the demo code is already set up to graph
earthquake data and you can mod it to graph city data instead.

Step 3. Graph them in BRIDGES on top of an overlay of the world and of the
United States. There is demo code already loaded up for you that will grab
earthquake data and display it on top of the world. This is there to show you
how you can put lat/long data with labels on top of the map of the world.

For example:
https://bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/assignments/356/wkerney

Step 4. Remove all the code between the -----'s that pull actual earthquake
data.  Don't graph any actual earthquakes. If you do, you will get a 0.
What you want to do is use the existing functionality for graphing earthquakes
to graph cities instead. You want to change this code so that it uses your
lat/long data for cities, and the names of cities when you hover over them.
Set the "magnitude" of the earthquakes to the population of the cities, and
then color code them based on their population sizes.

Demo code for all of this exists already in main.cc.
You just need to look at it and *adapt* the code. This is a crucial CS skill.

Once you can graph all the cities on the world map, change the project number
so you don't overwrite it when you move to the next step.

Step 5. Do it again, this time for cities in the US. You'll need to swap the
bridges.setMap() line of code to the one that is commented out so that it uses
the overlay for the US instead of the world (change "world" to "us").

Send the link for this project also to me on Canvas. You probably should make
a Word document or something with both links in it, and a screenshot of both.

You're done!

Grading:
10/10 A nice color-coded map of all the main cities in the US and in the world
-1 if you don't color code them based on population size (demo code exists
that color codes them based on lat/long - don't use that)
-3 if you only do one of the maps (US vs World) and not the other
-3 if you don't have an overlay on both graphs
