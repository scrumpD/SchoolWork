To be or not to be, that is the question
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them

To die
To sleep
Aye there's a consummation devoutly to be wished

To die
To sleep
To sleep perchance to dream
Aye there's the rub
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
Must give us pause

For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
The proud man's contumely
The pangs of love despised
When he might his quietus make 
With a bare bodkin?


For who would fardles bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life
But that the fear of something after death
That undiscovered country
From whose bourne no traveller returns 
Puzzles the will
And thus does conscience make cowards of us all
And thus enterprises of great pith and merit
In this regard their currents go awry
And lose the name of action
