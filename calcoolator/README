Homework - In your "Calcoolator" directory

Rarely will a program be simple input/output like you have
done so far. The "brains" of your program is in conditionals. 
Conditionals allow you to verify input to see if there are errors
or if you want to check what decision a user made. In this
assignment, you will get practice writing a program and using 
basic C++ libraries such as <cmath>. 
Check the link out here: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cmath.
You will write a program that will enable a user to do a variety
of mathematical calculations. All strings should end with a newline.

You must do it from scratch - don't forget the magic!

It will need to do the following:

1. Prompt the user with the following string:
	"1) Simple Arithmetic 2) Square Root 3) Exponents 4) Trig: "

2. Input their choice into an integer variable named whatever you want.

3. Depending on their choice, prompt the user with the following string:
	3a. IF choice == 1, prompt the user with "1) addition 2) subtraction 3) multiplication 4) division: "
	3b. IF choice == 2, prompt the user with "Please enter the number to square root: "
	3c. IF choice == 3, prompt the user with "Please enter two numbers: "
	3d. If choice == 4, prompt the user with "1) sine 2) cosine 3) tangent: "

4. Depending on their choice, have the user input one integer into a variable named whatever you want.
   NOTE: IF choice == 3, have the user input two integers into two integer variables named whatever you want

5. Depending on their choice, do the following:
	5a. IF choice == 1, prompt the user with the following string: "Please enter two numbers: "
	5b. IF choice == 2, output the square root and quit (If the user inputs 4, it should print 2)
	5c. IF choice == 3, output the power of the first variable to the power of the second variable and quit (If user inputs 2 3, it should print 8)
	5d. IF choice == 4, prompt the user with the following string: "Please enter a number: " 

6. Depending on their choice, do...
	6a. IF choice == 1, read into two integer variables named whatever you want.
	6b. IF choice == 4, read into one FLOAT variable named whatever you want.

7. Do the math of their choice.
	6a. IF choice == 1 ("Simple Arithmetic") and then if secondChoice == 2 ("subtraction"), and the user inputted 6 and 3, you'd output 3 (6 - 3 = 3).
	6b. IF choice == 4 ("Trig") and then if secondChoice == 1 ("sine"), and the user inputted 0, you'd output 0.

8. Validate the input. If any errors, print "BAD INPUT!" and quit. Potential errors: 
	7a. NO DIVISION BY ZERO (or modulus by zero)
	7b. Check to make sure they type within the valid range, for example a number between 1 and 4
	7c. Check for negative square root values, these are imaginary numbers
	7d. Check user input for valid values passed in. If the user types "addition" when you expected an int, that is an error

EXTRA CREDIT!!!

9. Add modulus as option #5 in prompt 3a. Don't change the prompt (in #3a), it will be a
   secret easter egg. Also modify #7 so it doesn't output BAD INPUT! on a 5.

10. Add logarithms as an option #5 in prompt #1. Don't change the prompt (in #1), it will also
    be a secret easter egg. YOU WILL WANT TO COMPUTE IN BASE 10!
	10a. Prompt the user with: "Please enter a number: "
	10b. Make a float variable whatever you want and read into it
	10c. Output the result and quit
	10d. Check for invalid inputs, bad input on a zero or negative number.
