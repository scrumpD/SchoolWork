Do you remember seeing times tables back in 2nd grade?

For this assignment, you will generate addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
division, and remainder tables for use in a classroom. At every step along the way, 
you must vet the input from the user, and if they type something bad, you must quit 
the program with a "BAD INPUT!" error message.

Step 1) The user will input what kind of table they want. They will type 
1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division, 
and 5 for remainder. Possible Errors: The user types in something that is 
not an integer, or the user types something other than 1-5.

Step 2) The user will enter what the minimum and maximum numbers on the table
are (these are inclusive, so if they type in 1 and 12, it will have all
numbers from 1 to 12 on the times table)
Possible Errors: The user types in something not an integer, the user types in
a minimum greater than the maximum, the user types in something that will
result in a table being bigger than 20x20 (the maximum size allowed)

Step 3) You will output the corresponding operation (+, -, X, /, %) if 
you are doing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or modulus
respectively. You will then output all the column headers on the top row.
Then you will print each row. Each row will have a row header, followed by
the results in each entry in the table. Each entry in the table will be 
separated by a tab ("\t") character.

Possible Errors: Consider what happens when you divide or modulus by 0. 
If Division by Zero occurs, print the table as you normally would BUT
every time you divide by 0, output "nan" (not a number) in the table itself.
DO NOT QUIT THE PROGRAM ON DIVISION BY ZERO! 
Another Error: Formatting of the headers. Be sure you do this right or it
will not pass the autograder.

Pro Tip: Try just getting a normal times table (from 1 to 12) working before
doing the rest of the assignment.
