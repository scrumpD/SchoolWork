==========================================

Purpose: To teach how to sample a continuous function and graph it using
BRIDGES. And how to take existing code that does something similar to what you
want and *adapting* it to do what you want.

Goal: Make a graphing calculator! 

The demo code will show you how to draw a sine wave from -2 to 8 by sampling
it every 0.3 units. Sampling every .3 units makes it kinda smooth kinda rough,
you will be able to pick out the individual lines in it. Example:
https://bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/assignments/357/wkerney

You will prompt the user to enter a polynomial (one way or another).

You must change the domain from -2 to 8 to -10 to 10. (The domain means the x
values the graph covers.)
You will change the range from -2 to 2 to whatever the minimum and maximum y
values are for the polynomial.

You will graph it from x = -10 to x = 10, sampling it every .01 units.

Do this for three different equations. You must submit three different
links (change the project number each time!) as well as screenshots on
Canvas with each link graphing a different polynomial.

Grading:
10/10 if you can input and graph any valid polynomials
8/10 if you have a limited input system for inputting polynomials
6/10 if you just hardcode a few equations and graph them.
-1 if you didn't change the viewport to match the right domain and range
-1 if you didn't change the sampling rate
